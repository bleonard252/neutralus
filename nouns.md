|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Nominative | Festiv**a**           | Festiv**as**                |
| Possessive | Festiv**as**          | Festiv**ias** (or -ais)     |

| Type 2     | Singular             | Plural                   |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Nominative | Angli**us**          | Angli**i**               |
| Possessive | Angli**ius**         | Angli**is**              |

Nouns should be usable in both types 1 and 2 interchangeably.

For indirect objects (dative), use an accusative that is (clearly) not in a list of accusatives, i.e. *Zea reades fabulas liberus.* (Eng. *(S)he reads a story to the child.*)

## Migrating
* From Latin (1st (-a, -ae) and 2nd (-us, -i or -um, -i) declension regular nouns only): The stem comes directly from the Latin stem (i.e. genitive minus -ae or -i, i.e. villa, villae -> vill).
* From Spanish: 
    * Feminine nouns ending in -a can be directly included into the Type 1 nominative case. The stem excludes the -a. (i.e. senorita -> senorit)
    * For masculine nouns ending in -o, remove the -o for the stem. (i.e. juego -> jueg)
    * For masculine nouns ending in -or, use that directly as the stem. (i.e. doctor, senor)
* From English (ending in -us, -um, -i, -a, -ae, -as, -or): 
    * If the noun ends in -or, use that as the stem. (i.e. doctor)
    * If the noun ends in -us or -um, use that as the nominative form, removing the -us or -um for the stem. (i.e. cactus)
    * If the noun ends in -a, -ae, -i, or -as, remove the ending and use it as the stem. (i.e. agenda)

## Proper Nouns
If a proper noun ends in one of the singular nominative endings (excluding multi-word proper nouns), it is declinable.
If it has plural endings instead, it is declinable, but must be used with plural endings only.
Otherwise, the proper noun is indeclinable.
