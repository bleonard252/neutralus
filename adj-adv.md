# Adjectives and Adverbs

Adjectives and adverbs are non-declinable.

Adjective  | Type 1 Adverb
-----------|--------------
rube**al** | quick**ly**, quick**lius**, quick**lisset**

Adverbs come *directly* from English. Adjectives are pretty English derived, what with the -al stem.
The catch is, however: adjectives **HAVE** to end in -al and normal adverbs **HAVE** to end in -ly.

## Types of Adverbs
Some adverbs have different uses than you'd think an adverb would, such as "Why". The following adverbs are special words:
* Interrogatives (i.e. why, when, who) are used in a [special sentence structure][ss].

## Migrating Adjectives
* From English (-al only): These adjectives come directly in.
* From Latin: use -al as an ending (i.e. rubeal)
* From Spanish: same as [nouns][n], but add -al to the stem (i.e. claro -> claral, constante -> constantal).

## Migrating Adverbs
* From English (-ly only): These adverbs come directly in.
* From Spanish (-mente only): replace -mente with -ly or -ily (i.e. claro -> clarily, constante -> constantly [which is the same as English]).

## Numbers
Since numbers are adjectives, the following is a list of numbers in their decimal notation and notation in words.
\#  | Ordinal         | Cardinal
----|-----------------|----------------
1   | un**ial**       | un**eral**
2   | du**ial**       | du**eral**
3   | trip**ial**     | trip**eral**
4   | quad**ial**     | quad**eral**
5   | quint**ial**    | quint**eral**
6   | hex**ial**      | hex**eral**
7   | sept**ial**     | sept**eral**
8   | oct**ial**      | oct**eral**
9   | nov**ial**      | nov**eral**
10  | dec**ial**      | dec**eral**

Note that the adjective "new" translates to "noval," and "nine" translates to "nov**i**al."

\#  | Ordinal         | Cardinal
----|-----------------|----------------
20  | decodu**ial**   | decodu**eral**
25  | decoduotrip**ial**|decodutrip**eral**
30  | decotrip**ial** | decotrip**eral**
100 | dedec**ial**    | dedec**eral**
200 | dedu**ial**     | dedu**eral**
1000| thous**ial**    | thous**eral**
1e4 | unor**ial**     | unor**eral**
1e5 | undecor**ial**  | undecor**eral**
1e6 | duor**ial**     | duor**eral**
1e9 | tripor**ial**   | tripor**eral**


Prefix | Root | Suffix
----------|---------|---------
de|dec|ial
du|or|ial
deco, duo|trip|ial
deco|du|ial
--|un|ial

The number stem can have an -o- to add a digit for numbers up to 1000. Above 999, after the -or-, add the other digit stems, going down as you go. For 1246, for example, it would come out to be thousodeduoquadohexial.
