# Neutralus
Neutralus will be an enhanced version of English, with some bases in Italian/Latin, Spanish, and other languages. Words are built by having a clear stem; that is, no irregular principal parts. Punctuative grammar is that of English (for now). Neutralus words are derived from some form of the word from a Romance language that can be "neutralized."
