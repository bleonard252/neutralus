# Verbs
Verbs are much simpler than in English and use less variants, requiring the use of context. Roots can end in any consonant.

## Vocabulary
**est:** root for the verb *to be*

## Migrating
* From English: remove -ing from the present active participle (i.e. running -> run, diving -> div, playing -> play)
* From Latin: use the present stem (i.e. amo, amare -> am; doceo, docere -> doc; dormio, dormire -> dorm)
* From Spanish: use the infinitive minus its ending (-ar, -er, -ir; i.e. hablar -> hab, jugar -> jug)

## Endings
* **-e:** (EE/AY/*silent*) Imperative (ex. Go *play!*)
* **-ig:** (IG) Participle: with implied tense and voice (ex. He was *running.*)
* **-o:** (O) Infinitive (ex. I like *to play.*)
* **-ed:** ('D/ID) Past tense indicative (ex. The children *played.*)
* **-es:** (EZ/ES) Present tense indicative (ex. He *runs.* or He *is running.*)
* **-il:** (IL) Future tense indicative (ex. He *will deliver.*)

## Modifiers
* **previ:** (PREH-vee/PREE-vee) Backs a verb tense up. i.e. making a Past (Perfect) into a Pluperfect
* **posti:** (POST-ee) Advances a verb tense. i.e. making a Future into a Future-Perfect or Present to Future
* **mus:** (MOOS/MUHS/MUS) Adds necessity. i.e. *must*, or *absolutely will* when paired with a future-tense verb
